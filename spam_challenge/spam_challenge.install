              <p>The most important date on the calendar, from the moment you get into a relationship, is your anniversary! As older and experienced couples would have you know, this day comes with a lot of added pressure to it- the pressure to get the right gift, to be able to showcase your feelings well enough and to make every anniversary better than the previous one.</p>
              <p>Feeling the stress of it already?</p>
              <p>Don't stress we've got you covered for a decade or so! Read On to know what the modern day 'traditional' anniversary gifts are, in accordance to the year you're in...</p>
              <p>1st Anniversary- clocks
              <br>Our interpretation- get gorgeous couple's watches for yourselves! Now we do know that 'watches' technically are the gift for one's 15th anniversary, but who said that you can only have one watch?
              <br>To personalize them you can get them etched with your anniversary date</p>
              <p>2nd Anniversary- China
              <br>Our Interpretation- A trip to the great wall of China!
              <br>Oh come on! Ladies shop for cutlery and china, all year round... their anniversary's should be something special, ergo a vacation to the great wonder of the world, it is. And if tradition, does weigh heavy on you; you can always get yourselves a porcelain plate as a souvenir from China.
              <br>Click a billion photographs and create an album of blissful memorabilia.</p>
              <p>3rd Anniversary- Crystal
              <br>This really doesn't require any other interpretations! Women love crystals... to wear and to decorate their homes with. As for the men... sorry boys, the smile on your lady's face should be rewarding enough for this anniversary!
              <br>If you do go in for crystal champagne flutes or a crystal pendant , you could get it etched as well with your initials or your anniversary date; but a word of caution- crystal is rather delicate and if you feel that the etching might damage your gift, avoid the personalization and get the better half a gorgeous card instead.</p>
              <p>4th Anniversary- Electrical Appliances
              <br>See boys... You have your day (well in this case- year) too.
              <br>Our Interpretation- get that TV your man has always wanted. Or better yet, upgrade your cars! If one of your couple's activity includes cooking together, then go the traditional route and get a new appliance for your kitchen.</p>
              <p>5th Anniversary- Silverware
              <br>Our interpretation- Jewelry. Because there really isn't any other interpretation, is there? We mean, what is one to do with a silver candelabra anyway? Instead- get the lady a pretty bracelet, and ladies, you'll can get your men, smart cufflinks or a lapel pin made of silver.
              <br>Silver is the easiest to personalize, if you are getting custom bracelets and cufflinks made, you could get the same pattern etched on the two!</p>
              <p>6th Anniversary- Wood
              <br>Our recommendation would be to go traditional, and get some furniture made of wood! It could be the side tables you'll always wanted or you could redecorate that room you've been meaning to since the past few months. We hate to play the Devil's advocate, but ladies, you could get a shoe closet made for all those stunning shoes of yours (and a few of his as well).</p>
              <p>7th Anniversary- Pens/Pencil sets
              <br>Every hard working, power couple would love this one! Get yourselves a matching pen set- our personal favorite is the his and her star walker set by Mont Blanc. Alternatively you'll could get each other a set of pens with your initials engraved on them.</p>
              <p>8th Anniversary- Lace and Linen
              <br>Our recommendation- new wardrobes for the happy couple!
              <br>We know! We know! Linen here; means new duvets and towels... but we bet you already have those... but no one can ever have enough clothes, right! And since linen is utterly in vogue, we suggest a little wardrobe make over.</p>
              <p>9th Anniversary- Leather
              <br>Our interpretation- a new handbag for the lady and a briefcase for her man.
              <br>Leather can be bought in various forms apart from office bags- like watches, jackets, or shoes; so you can pretty much pick which leather element you most want and get that for each other</p>
              <p>10th Anniversary –Diamond Jewelry
              <br>Now here's a language every lady speaks! JEWELRY!! Really, any form of diamonds (the real deal that is) is always welcome. As for the men, the lady by your side, is your jewelry.</p>

              <p>Your eyes are said to be the most expressive and defining features of your face. The eyes have the ability to take on many colour forms and brightness and can instantly captivate a crowd.

Keeping your eyes glued to the computer screen for extended hours becomes very taxing on your eyes. These so called desk-bounded jobs and hectic work schedules can cause your eyelids to droop even before we age. It's this tiredness we experience in everyday life that is attributing to sagging tissue and wrinkles under and around the eyes.
              <br>Expensive cosmetics and makeup can somewhat hide these saggy eyelids but cannot remove bags under your eyes, neither they can make your droopy upper lids look younger. The only effective procedure to take care of this tissue issue is eyelid cosmetic surgery or as it is know in the medical field as blepharoplasty (upper and lower eyelid surgery). This practice if properly performed can re-rejuvenate the eyelid contours by modifying the skin and fat in the eye area.</p>

              <p>The internet's been around for almost 35 years, yet we still haven’t learned our lesson about online passwords. According to a recent security study, the most commonly used web passwords are things like “<strong>123456</strong>” and “<strong>qwerty</strong>.” Sure, they’re easy to remember, but that makes them just as easy to hack. And if you use that simple password across multiple accounts, that puts all of your data at risk.</p>
              <p>1. Be careful where you write your password down. You have to force yourself to keep such information in a safe place. If you must write your passwords down, write them somewhere that only you have access to and don’t just leave them laying about.</p>
              <p>2. Do not use words or combinations of words and random characters as passwords since these methods will leave you vulnerable to dictionary searches.</p>
              <p>3. Use longer passwords with uppercase letters, lowercase letters numbers and even other characters if the application allows it. The process of searching all possible characters for password cracking has one major flaw. It takes a long time to work and the longer and more diverse your character combination is, the longer it will take to break.
              <br>For example a password that is several characters long with several combinations and types of characters might take years for an exhaustive search of characters to find the correct password.</p>
